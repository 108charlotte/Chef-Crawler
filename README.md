# Chef Crawler
A fun dungeon crawler where the player is an aspiring chef seeking to improve their culinary skills with exotic ingredients from the depths. 

# why I made it
I wanted to return to my experimentation with game development, which I first began in 8th grade when I learned Python and JavaScript. This time, I hoped to learn how more advanced games (than the snake game) are built, and how popular development platforms like Godot work. 

# how i made it
Since before starting this project I had never used Godot before or created anything more than simple python games, I had to use a lot of online resources to learn the ropes and bring my ideas to life. I used a video tutorial (see below) for the majority of the game, and I also used ChatGPT to help me debug the code. 

Here are some resources I would recommend: 
- This video tutorial on building a roguelike in Godot: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vQ1UGbUlzH4. I followed this tutorial to build all of the basic mechanics of my game, so I would definitely recommend it! 
- This article on uploading a godot game to itch: https://foosel.net/til/how-to-export-a-godot-4-game-to-run-on-the-web-on-itchio/. I definitely had a lot of trouble getting my zip to work and this article was very helpful!
